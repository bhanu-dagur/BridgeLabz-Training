# 📘 Learning Progress & Hands-On Implementation Log

---

# 📅 02 February 2026  
## 📘 Topic: OOP Design Principles

## 🔹 SOLID Principles

### S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change.  
Each class should handle only one responsibility.

### O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.

### L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Derived classes should be replaceable with their base classes without affecting correctness.  
Child classes must not break parent class behavior.

### I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.  
Prefer multiple small, specific interfaces over one large interface.

### D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.  
Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces).

---

## 🔹 Other Design Principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Keep the design simple and easy to understand.  
Avoid unnecessary complexity and over-engineering.  
Simple code is easier to maintain and debug.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Avoid duplicating code.  
Extract reusable logic into methods, classes, or utilities.  
This improves maintainability and reduces errors.

### DIY (Do It Yourself)
Learn by implementing concepts yourself.  
Break problems into smaller parts and solve them step by step.  
Hands-on implementation improves understanding and skill.

---

# 📅 03 February 2026  
## 📘 Topic: Design Patterns

Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems.  
They provide best practices to make code flexible, maintainable, and scalable.

---

## 🔹 Types of Design Patterns

### 1️⃣ Creational Design Patterns
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms.

- Singleton  
  Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.

- Factory Method  
  Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

- Abstract Factory  
  Provides an interface for creating families of related objects.

- Builder  
  Constructs complex objects step by step.

- Prototype  
  Creates new objects by copying an existing object.

---

### 2️⃣ Structural Design Patterns
These patterns deal with object composition and relationships.

- Adapter  
  Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

- Bridge  
  Separates abstraction from implementation so both can vary independently.

- Composite  
  Treats individual objects and groups of objects uniformly.

- Decorator  
  Adds new functionality to objects dynamically without modifying their structure.

- Facade  
  Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.

- Proxy  
  Provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object.

---

### 3️⃣ Behavioral Design Patterns
These patterns focus on communication between objects.

- Observer  
  Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, others are notified.

- Strategy  
  Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.

- Command  
  Encapsulates a request as an object.

- State  
  Allows an object to change behavior when its internal state changes.

- Template Method  
  Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method and lets subclasses override specific steps.

- Iterator  
  Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially.

- Mediator  
  Defines an object that controls communication between other objects.

---

## 🔹 Why Use Design Patterns?

- Improve code reusability  
- Make code easier to maintain  
- Reduce tight coupling  
- Follow industry best practices  
- Improve scalability and flexibility  

---

# 📅 04 February 2026  
## 📘 Topic: Multithreading in .NET

Multithreading means running multiple threads in parallel to improve performance and responsiveness.

### 🔹 Common Uses
- Background tasks (file I/O, network calls)  
- Parallel processing  
- Keeping UI responsive (WinForms/WPF)  

---

## 🔹 Thread vs Task

### Thread
- Lower-level API (System.Threading.Thread)  
- Manually created and managed  
- More control, heavier and harder to manage  

### Task
- Higher-level API (System.Threading.Tasks.Task)  
- Uses Thread Pool internally  
- Easier and recommended for async programming  

---

## 🔹 Threading Models in .NET

### 1️⃣ Thread (Manual Threading)
Create and run a thread manually.  
Used when full control is needed.

### 2️⃣ ThreadPool
Built-in reusable threads managed by .NET.  
Efficient for short tasks.

### 3️⃣ Task Parallel Library (TPL)
Modern approach.  
Supports:
- Task  
- Task.Run  
- Parallel.For  
- Parallel.ForEach  

### 4️⃣ async/await
Preferred for I/O-bound operations.  
Improves responsiveness without blocking threads.

---

## 🔹 Synchronization (Avoid Race Conditions)

### Common Issues
- Race Condition  
- Deadlock  
- Data Corruption  

### Solutions
- lock (Monitor)  
- Mutex  
- Semaphore / SemaphoreSlim  
- Interlocked  
- Concurrent Collections  

---

## 🔹 Common Problems

### Race Condition
Two threads update the same variable simultaneously → incorrect result.

### Deadlock
Thread A waits for Thread B, and Thread B waits for Thread A → program stuck.

### Starvation
A thread never gets CPU time because others keep running.

---

## 🔹 Best Practices

- Prefer Task + async/await  
- Avoid shared mutable state  
- Use thread-safe collections  
- Keep lock blocks small  
- Avoid blocking ThreadPool threads
