Day 01
Date: 18/12/2025

Overview
This repository contains my Day 1 learning progress for .NET Full Stack Development.
All topics are studied as part of the Prerequisite & Foundation setup for C# and .NET.
All coding is done using a normal text editor, and programs are compiled & executed using command-line tools, following best industry practices.

Topics Covered
 During my training, I learned the basic setup and fundamentals required to start working with .NET and C#. This included installing and understanding tools like Git Bash, a simple text editor (Notepad++), the .NET SDK, and setting up GitHub for version control. I studied the basic elements of programming such as variables, literals, primitive data types, basic input and output, and commonly used operators in C#. I   also learned the importance of following proper naming conventions to write clean and readable code. Along with programming basics, I gained an understanding of the history and evolution of C# and how the   .NET platform works. I went through the .NET FS Maker Plan to understand the learning roadmap for full stack development. Additionally, I learned Git basics, including how to track code changes, use common Git  commands, and follow a proper Git workflow. Throughout the training, all coding was done using a normal text editor and programs were compiled and executed using command-line commands, which helped me          understand real-world development practices.

Task for the Day:
Today, I studied the given documentation to understand the basics of .NET and C# and practiced problem-solving questions. I also completed the assigned programming tasks by writing and executing code using command-line tools.
What's Next: solve practice problem of the assignment 1.



Day 02

Date: 19/12/2025 Topics: Architecture, Access Modifiers,C# Operators,C# Datatypes, Entry Point Of C#/.net, Features of C#
What I Learned

Architecture: .net uses two compilers Msil and CLR. How It Integrates with other languages. Access Modifiers: public,private,protected,internal. C# Operators: Arithmetic operators(+,-,*,/,%,++),Relational operators(>,<,>=,<=,==,!),Logical operators(&&,||,!) Datatypes: Difference between Primitive and Non Primitive datatypes. Entry point of c#: Main method is the entry point of a program in C#. It is called by the runtime environment when the application starts executing. Features of C#: Object-oriented programming (OOP) features like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation etc.

Task for the Day: 1.Use all the primitive datatypes and store them in a csharp script and pust it onto github. 2.Use all the operators and store them in a csharp script and push it onto github.
                  2. c# Programming Element Level 01 has been solved.

What's Next: C# Programming Elements Level-02. lab assignment will be solved.
