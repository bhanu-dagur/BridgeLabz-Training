1. Handling File Not Found Exception
💡 Problem Statement:
Create a C# program that reads a file named "data.txt". If the file does not exist, handle the IOException properly and display a user-friendly message.
Expected Behavior:
If the file exists, print its contents.
If the file does not exist, catch the IOException and print "File not found".
