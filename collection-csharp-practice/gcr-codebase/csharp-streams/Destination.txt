File Handling - Read and Write a Text File 

Problem Statement: Write a C# program that reads the contents of a text file and writes it into a new file. If the source file does not exist, display an appropriate message. 
Requirements: Use FileStream for reading and writing. Handle IOException properly. Ensure that the destination file is created if it does not exist.
